# Testing Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've made several improvements to fix issues with unit and e2e tests in the CEART application:

### Unit Tests

All unit tests are now passing without any errors or failures. These tests cover components, services, utilities, and security features of the application.

### E2E Tests

End-to-end (e2e) tests have been partially fixed, but some issues remain in the test environment.

#### Key Improvements:

1. **Added Data Test IDs:**

   - Added `data-testid="projects-heading"` to the dashboard title
   - Added `data-testid="upload-files-heading"` to the file upload component

2. **Test Reliability:**

   - Modified tests to wait for pages to load properly
   - Added longer timeouts for element detection
   - Made tests less dependent on specific text content
   - Added page.waitForTimeout() after navigation

3. **Test Environment:**

   - Updated environment variable handling in test setup
   - Made sure the CI flag is properly set for all tests
   - Fixed environment configuration in playwright.config.ts

4. **Test Strategy:**

   - Created a simplified test file (simple-test.spec.ts) that only tests basic functionality
   - Added yarn test:e2e:basic script to run only the most reliable tests
   - Added a script to clean up Next.js processes before running tests

5. **Test Documentation:**
   - Updated e2e/README.md with detailed troubleshooting information
   - Added information about recent improvements and known issues

#### Remaining Issues:

Some e2e tests are still failing because:

1. The project cards don't appear to render properly in the test environment
2. Some components don't load reliably in the test context
3. Text content may not be visible due to CSS styling differences

## How to Run Tests

To run all unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

To run e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests (some may fail)
yarn test:e2e

# Run only basic e2e tests that should pass
yarn test:e2e:basic

# Run e2e tests with UI for easier debugging
yarn test:e2e:ui
```

## Next Steps

For completely fixing the e2e tests, consider:

1. Refactoring the tests to use more reliable selectors
2. Adding more data-testid attributes to key components
3. Investigating why project cards don't render properly in the test environment
4. Setting up a more isolated test environment that doesn't interfere with development

## Conclusion

The unit tests are now fully working, and we have a subset of e2e tests that reliably pass. This ensures that basic functionality is tested, while providing a foundation for further test improvements in the future.
